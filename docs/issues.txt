   - Added page unload event handlers (beforeunload, visibilitychange, pagehide) to VoiceRoomInterface.tsx
   - Implemented heartbeat monitoring every 30 seconds with user activity tracking
   - Added Page Visibility API integration to detect when users become inactive
   - Created graceful disconnect utility with retry logic and multiple disconnect strategies
   - Emergency disconnect using navigator.sendBeacon for reliable signaling on page unload
   
   Backend Changes:
   - Enhanced backend cleanup logic with reduced inactivity threshold (2 minutes instead of 5)
   - Added heartbeat event handlers to both main and voice room socket services
   - Increased cleanup frequency from 5 minutes to 30 seconds for faster user removal
   - Improved logging and warning system for inactive users
   - Added user activity tracking with heartbeat acknowledgments
   
   Result: Users are now properly removed from speaker slots and queue within 2 minutes of disconnection, with most removals happening within 30 seconds due to more frequent cleanup cycles.
